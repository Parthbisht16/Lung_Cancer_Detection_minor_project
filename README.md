# Lung_Cancer_Detection_minor_project

Lung cancer stands as a significant global health concern, accounting for a substantial portion of cancer-related deaths. 
The lack of efficient and timely detection methods has been a major impediment to improving patient outcomes. 
Traditional diagnostic approaches, such as manual interpretation of medical images like X-rays and CT scans, are prone to human error and may result in delayed diagnosis. 
Therefore, there is an urgent need for a robust and automated system that can accurately and efficiently identify potential lung cancer lesions in medical images.

This project aims to develop and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based solution for lung cancer detection. 
The primary challenge is to create a deep learning model capable of analysing medical images with a high degree of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
